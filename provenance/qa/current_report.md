Engine Development owns mechanics fixes. QA runs isolated, synthetic campaigns and reports observed behavior.

## IRGS-QA-001

Accepted Core material establishment breaks Rise playthrough views

**Expected:** Reject an unsupported material atomically, or retain a readable campaign with explicit unknown unit support.

**Boundary:** IRGS_Web/rise_campaigns.py view indexes model.units[material]; Core stock establishment accepts material IDs without that unit binding.

Reproduce:

1. Create a reviewed R00 Rise campaign.
2. Creator POST /api/event: establish_stock(location=founder-home, material=water, quantity=2, inventory_evidence_ref=synthetic-measured-water).
3. Observe the successful save and valid CoreWorld state.
4. GET /api/playthrough/<id> with the normal session token.

## IRGS-QA-002

Canonical Core location records are incompatible with Rise location consumers

**Expected:** A supported, established location confirmation must leave local inventory and supported movement usable.

**Boundary:** Core confirm_character_field writes {value,evidence_id,at}; settlement_runtime.location and Rise view consume the whole record as a site string.

Reproduce:

1. Create R00 at the commons.
2. Creator records and delivers established evidence placing the founder at commons.
3. Creator confirms founder.location=commons through confirm_character_field with authority and player instruction references.
4. Inspect local inventory and submit walk_clearing.

## Scope

Current Core/App regression suites plus independent HTTP checks. Contracts: R00 founding, shared Core interoperability, material continuity, replay, restart, privacy and retained intent.

This report is not full C2/T01–T37 certification. Skips and missing providers are not passes. No user campaign was loaded or migrated.
